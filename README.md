🏦 Bank Loan Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to understand customer behavior, loan performance, and risk factors.
The analysis helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals, defaults, and portfolio management.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze loan approval and rejection trends
Identify key factors affecting loan default
Understand customer demographics and loan distribution
Provide insights to improve loan decision strategies

🗂 Dataset Description

In today’s data-driven banking environment, understanding customer financial behavior is essential for making accurate loan approval decisions.
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Bank Loan Approval Dataset to identify key factors that influence whether a customer’s loan application is approved or rejected.

The dataset includes customer demographic details, financial information, and banking behavior.
By applying Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, meaningful insights are extracted through data visualization and statistical analysis.
